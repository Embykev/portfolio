                    <p>The objective of this project was to build a structure as a group of seven,
                    using only four materials from a list of options, that would hold up weght while being it is being hit.
                    There are no pictures of the completed structure, but it was a three-pointed pyramid of bamboo shoots, held together at the joints by duct tape
                    and strung through with copper wire. I came up with the copper wire idea and helped string it through holes in the bamboo.
                    I also helped helped with the measuring and cutting of the bamboo.
                    From this I learned how to use tools to measure and modify things, as well as the basics of making a stable structure from this.

                    <p>The objective of this proeject was to create a multi-level game in Scratch, whose ending and progression could be affected by the player's actions.
                    The project was only two people, my partner and I. The game was a simple maze game with multiple levels, looping sounds, secret levels,and hint and reset functions
                    It had multiple backgrounds as well. I did all of the sound design, creating both functional looping music and sound effects for restarting or completing a level.
                    Not only that, but I came up with the mechanics of the secret levels, programmed the reset button, made the reset button sprite, and did almost all of

                    <p>The objective of this project was to create an app in MIT's App Inventor with a partner that would take an established base idea and build upon it.
                    We made what was called "Paintpot with Camera. It was a drawing program that allowed you to take a picture and use it as the background to draw on.
                    We expanded upon it by adding multiple ways of erasing what had been draw, RGB color sliders used to make custom colors,
                    the ability to change the size of lines and dots, and the ability to see what custom color has been created by the RGB sliders.
                    I built the base code of the program, along with the UI. I did most of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/166C9d2_9MMZKv1wDgnYqiJZT0cmIzwnjrhNxiKNrWM0/edit">the documentation</a> as well.
                    From this I learned how to design a UI, along with how to package the code for apps.

                    <p> The objective of this project was to take a pre-existing
                    animation in Scratch, and add an additional animation to it. 
                    It was a solo project and I decided to amplify the ridiculousness of the animation I was to build on.
                    Where the previous animation had an innocent child talking to an octopus, I expanded upon this, making him slowly realize he was actually schizophrenic.
                    From this, I learned how to create new animations and sprites within scratch, how to make a sprite spin rapidly, and how to apply create music loops.
                    The sprite spinning was the greatest challenge, as when the animation was reset, the sprite did not reset to its inital orientation, and I was forced to figure out how to fix unitended bugs.
                    Most of my animation and musical experience came from this project.</p>

                    <p> The objective of this project was to create a text-adventure game in python using if-then statements.
                    I worked with one other person, which was both the fun part and the challenge. Ours was about a person stuck in a dream trying to escape while avoiding strange deaths.
                    I learned how to properly use if-then statements and make a program reset itself by looping back around to the beginning.
                    While I wrote most of the code and many of the ideas for the story, my partner wrote out the text itself, as well as refined my ideas.

                    <p>The objective of this project was to create a themed hangman game in python that would end after a certain number of guesses.
                    I worked with my partner from the previous python project on this one. We both worked together to code and figure out the logic of the function.
                    I from this I gained a greater understanding of python logic and how to use inputs in a python function. 
                    This one was harder and less fun than the text adventure, as it was less making a story and more programming, but I feel it was a valuable experience.

                    <p> The objective of this project was to create an image manipulation program, which would take a group of image of different sizes and add a border a specific theme.
                    It was a group project and my partner and I, and we decided on creating a border with a cooking/culinary theme.
                    We both worked together to figure out the logic required to do the manipulations require, as well as how to make the manipulation en masse.
                    The later is where we had trouble, as created the functions required easily, but making it apply to everything took us almost a week to figure out.
                    This project was immensly frustrating during that last week until my partner figured it out.
                    However, from this I learned the usefulness of isolated tests for functions, as well as how to manipulate PIL and .png images using python.
