                    <p> I'm a student currently going to Dublin High, with plans to go into the sciences.
                    I've always been fascinated by the discoveries of science and how they can be applied to our everyday lives.
                    I plan on getting a career in science, but I'm still experimenting, trying to find which one I want to make my career.
                    <br> 
                    <br>I'm usually quite humble about myself, but when it comes to working on a project in a group,
                    I'm good at both being a leader and a regular team member. I'm always reliable, being the one you can trust get stuff done.
                    I've directed and written multiple group skits for Drama. I worked on a group engineering project and skit in Destination Imagination. 
                    I've worked with many people on tons of group projects in my years at school, and from that I've learned how to be a leader. 
                    I work well with people and when I'm given a big project, I will always be as enthusiastic about, and enjoy every minute.
                    <br>
                    <br>I am looking forward to continuing my understand how sciences change our world, whether through engineering or chemistry. 
                    I hope to be part of that change. Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio!
